"Subject: extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe - cera  insight  title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184  overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern  europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas  directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by  2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for  candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the  decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view  current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the  internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an  investor  , s point of view .  the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the  implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the  european commission and the world bank in paris in november .  many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries  throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the  results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas  directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu  candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road  map to guide them .  the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and  candidate countries include the following :  * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of  enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all  candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly  established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory  bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although  issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political  influence are not uniformly resolved .  * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate  countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have  adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the  commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement  in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the  implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay  contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies  and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to  single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal  markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant  players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by  their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange  for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive  provides for !  a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay  obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate  countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .  furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only  one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market  status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another  member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to  call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the  european union .  * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are  financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in  various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have  been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .  this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of  imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks  that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but  the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1  indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected  to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself  cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries  that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry  to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .  * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission  companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of  liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is  all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .  in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal  separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate  countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .  table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the  table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very  recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the  directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries  scheduled for the first wave .  * * end * *  follow above url for full report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 !

"" that was my  motivation . the second problem was that the logos themselves , even if it  made sense to do them in gold , made the design too busy - a lot of the  appeal in these "" word "" mugs is the clean , linear look . finally , i think  lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances  that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will  display this mug on their desk or on their shelves .  i think the mug will look quite stunning and i think the display of finance  terms will make it an interesting conversion piece - i ' ve never seen  anything like it in academics , let alone in finance . i think enron ' s  sponsorship of the seminar series will get noticed when people follow their  interest in the mugs to say "" what is this ? where ' d this come from ?

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

( as of june  19 )  2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a  total outright of 63 . 765 mt .  this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var  ( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .  in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not  consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like  that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .  i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .  3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as  many fields are blank .  lets talk tomorrow on the phone .  attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june  19 ) as requested by kirstee .

""  i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in  their own time .  on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .  the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me  across the yard thirty times and won every time .  the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had  such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot  approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a  space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our  imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .  our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to  make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and  cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i  thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my  children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination  to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and  giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .  i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a  bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t  talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used  when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .  i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .  i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my  daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .  most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it  comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or  reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,  computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have  imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but  children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .  when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me  and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . ""  "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply .  "" i don ' t know what to do . ""  "" go outside and find a friend . ""  "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ""  "" use your imagination .

"" you know the routine .  sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching  someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be  better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available  to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will  pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard  of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large  cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants .  i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence  to have fun ?

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

"Subject: re : status  clayton ,  we can discuss your request when i come back to the office on monday .  regarding the trip to portland . such a trip requires an explicit prior  permission from your boss ,  myself in his absence , or stinson in my and vasant ' s absence .  in case you did not ask for such a permission before , the request is denied .  vince  clayton vernon @ enron  07 / 20 / 2000 03 : 12 pm  to : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",0

"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology  hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace  the cohen report  viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity .  direct liquid methanol fuel cell  direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc .  the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers .  arroyo sciences , inc .  arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments .  the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe .  deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo .  ionfinity  ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up .  additional projects under review  projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus .  forecasts and valuation  we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis .  directors and management  dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company .  aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett - packard and control data corporation .  dr . sandeep gulati has been with viaspace since 2000 . during the prior 12 years , dr gulati was head of the ultracomputing technologies at nasas jpl . dr . gulati is the developer of the revolutionary signal processing technology , qri .  viaspace overview  viaspace was formed in july 1998 with an objective of transforming technologies from caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other advanced technology centers into profitable commercial enterprises through its strong connections with the advanced technology community . through its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - viaspace has a diversified high tech portfolio that includes microelectronics , sensors , homeland security public safety , energy / - fuel cells , information computational technology , rfid , e - finance , and mobile e - commerce .  viaspace develops proven space and defense technologies into hardware and software products that fulfill high - growth market needs and solve today ' s complex problems .  viaspace benefits from important licenses and strategic relationships with caltech / nasa ' s jet propulsion laboratory and other universities research laboratories . the viaspace team has a proven expertise for the successful commercialization of innovations in information technology , physical science and life sciences developed at academic research institutions and national laboratories .  the company currently focuses on technologies originally developed for nasa and the us department of defense that have already reached a certain stage of maturity . initial investments in these technologies amount to millions of dollars and many years of rd , enabling viaspace to manage the commercialization process with only a modest additional investment and greatly reduced technical risk .  viaspace couples exceptional technology sourcing and validation capability with a demand - driven process of market validation . decisions about technology transfer and product development are based , first and foremost , on market needs . in addition to our internal expertise , viaspace benefits from the domain expertise of leading experts that serve on our scientific and business advisory boards and from an informal global network of researchers , technology analysts , and technology professionals and investors that would be hard to replicate .  in the last six years , viaspace and its subsidiaries have secured more than $ 30 million in venture financing and strategic investment . initial investors include hewlett packard , divine interventures , los angeles county community development commission , blueprint ventures , the united company , bioprojects international , forrest binkley brown , american river ventures , and nth power .  viaspace has spawned 3 companies : spectrasensors  ( www . spectrasensors . com ) , qwip technologies  ( www . qwip . com ) , and vialogy corp ( www . vialogy . com ) . these companies , currently at various stages of maturity , are positioned within high growth markets and poised for profitability . today , viaspace focuses its effort on its three subsidiaries - - arroyo sciences , ionfinity , and direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) - - and on new high technology opportunities . view full report  view full report  to join market movers mailings press here to find out more .  2400 lincoln ave  altadena , ca 91001  safe harbor statement  this information is a paid advertisement . any views expressed herein are provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as an offer , an endorsement , or inducement to buy or sell securities . bronks communications , inc .

"" this new market standard should put into place the necessary market  improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement a  customized market system for new england , "" said william w . berry , chairman and  acting ceo of iso new england . "" now is the time to stop the experimentation .  ultimately , we hope the standard market design will serve as the benchmark for  wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country , if not around the  world . ""  "" pjm is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive  wholesale  electricity market , "" said phillip g . harris , chairman and ceo of pjm . "" along  with the progress in the implementation of the pjm west concept , this  initiative  will provide an even broader standardized market design . ""  this approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers  across  different markets and promote ferc ' s goal of creating a seamless marketplace .  "" we intend to continue to work with the new york iso on issues of mutual  importance , "" stated mr . berry . "" this new market design , together with our  efforts to address the market "" seams "" and other coordination issues , will  eventually bring the three northeast iso markets closer together . "" iso new  england and the new york iso will continue to work together on these issues  under a joint board resolution passed on january 16 , 2001 .  "" because of our geographic location , new york is in the center of the  northeast  markets , with iso new england , pjm and imo each on one of our borders . we  support the continued elimination of barriers across northeast trading markets  to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will benefit , "" said  william j . museler , president and ceo of the new york independent system  operator . "" the new york iso will continue to work with our neighboring markets  to remove barriers to trading across the region and to move towards larger  regional markets . ""  this proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with  stakeholder  input . iso new england will propose the standard market design to the new  england conference of public utility commissioners and the new england power  pool in a series of meetings next week . additional meetings will be conducted  in the next few weeks . the standard market design for new england will be  subject to ferc approval .  "" standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a  market ' s efficiency . a market that moderates price fluctuations and  encourages  investment based on an expected return is an efficient market - - and  efficiency  is the key to establishing market liquidity , "" said alain steven , ceo of alstom  esca .

"" let ntpc and power trading corporation of india ( ptc ) come  together and sell dpc ' s surlpus power . we have already mooted this  suggestion , but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power  ministry , "" the official said . the official said that the centre , which was  also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to  enron india , should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess  power to other states . the state government ' s reaction comes in wake of union  power minister suresh prabhu ' s discussion with chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh in delhi few days ago . it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh  "" there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term  ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states "" .  deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess  power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the dpc ' s 740  mw phase - i and soon to be commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 mw , to other needy  states . considering the high cost of power generated from dpc , which during  the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost  of rs 2 . 30 - 2 . 80 a unit from central and state utilities , there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol , the power minister reportedly said .  "" deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down , "" he said , adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , monday , 7 may 2001  reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de , s ravindran & renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice , the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447 - mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) does not lift power . the project  , s power purchase  agreement ( ppa ) has a clause to this effect . the state government  , s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company  , s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties .  dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company  , s  application had been pending with the chief minister  , s office for months .  only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state . the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb  , s inability to buy power from  it , thanks to the board  , s weak financial position . not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra , but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state . the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so . nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold . so , in effect , this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb . the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue  from such consumers .  apart from captive power plants , independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards . they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status . with  its 447 - mw capacity , the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1 , 000  mw . speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week , reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard : a provision  in third parties . ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb  , s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project .  the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state , a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions . a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official . subsequently , it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power . so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties , he said . the patalganga project along with the ispat group  , s 1 , 082  mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the economic times , may 7 , 2001  no need of patalganga , bhadravati power : mseb  the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much - delayed reliance  industries - promoted patalganga and ispat industries ' bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that "" there is no need of these projects nor their power "" . the  loss - making board has communicated to the government that mseb had "" no  interest "" in patalganga and bhadravati , as it did not have escrow - able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra , state government sources said here on sunday .  "" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . "" all the three were cleared  as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire  since last nine years , "" they added .  moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc  calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s  patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs  7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he  informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and  it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent .

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: el paso statement on california situation  in case you haven ' t already seen this :  el paso addresses the california energy situation ( february 26 , 2001 )  houston , feb . 26 / prnewswire / - - el paso corporation ( nyse : epg )  reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties  involved to help improve california ' s energy situation . "" we are surprised  to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning el paso ' s  involvement in california , "" said norma dunn , senior vice president of  corporate communications and external affairs at el paso corporation . "" we  would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record . "" the  significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power  supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power , which  has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate  electricity . high natural gas prices are , therefore , an effect rather than  a cause of the power shortage . allegations that natural gas prices were  deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the el paso natural gas  pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue . it is not  possible for any holder of capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline to  cause a significant increase in california gas prices by refusing to use  that capacity . the el paso natural gas pipeline is required by law to post  the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is  obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate  found to be just and reasonable by the federal energy regulatory  commission . all capacity held by el paso merchant energy on the el paso  natural gas pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to  serve california and other western markets . allegations that there was a  "" conspiracy "" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into  california are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge . the  facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990 s were either  built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer  support to justify their construction . for example , despite years of  marketing efforts by tenneco , not a single potential customer could be  induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed  altamont project to proceed . for that reason alone , it was ultimately  dropped . in 1996 , according to estimates , there were between one and two  billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) of excess natural gas transportation  capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving california . indeed , it  was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess  capacity that prompted the california public utilities commission to  encourage pg & e , socal edison , and socal gas , beginning in 1996 and  continuing into 1998 , to relinquish over 1 . 5 bcf / d of firm transportation  capacity on the el paso natural gas pipeline . processes are now under way  to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity  into california , and el paso intends to do its part to help satisfy  whatever needs may be established today . as recently as last year , there  were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available  on the el paso natural gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands  at that time . notwithstanding its availability , this capacity was not used  by shippers to california to fill in - state natural gas storage facilities  for future use . if california had taken advantage of the opportunity in  2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999 ,  reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in  prices at the california border could have been substantially mitigated or  avoided . it is now widely recognized that the california "" energy crisis ""  was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in california  to keep pace with the state ' s economy and increased demand . a combination  of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices . first , the construction  of new power plants in california is a slow , difficult , and heavily  regulated process . as a result , the growing demand has far outstripped  in - state generating capabilities . second , unfavorable precipitation and  increased out - of - state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power  normally relied on by california to become unavailable . third , increased  demand for power in the western united states drove up prices that  california had to pay to out - of - state generators . fourth , state policies  deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers ,  leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their  costs . fifth , because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased  costs to consumers , the utilities ' creditworthiness was impaired , causing  supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and  expensive to purchase . sixth , the early and greater - than - normal use of  peaking units - plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand  conditions - necessitated unscheduled maintenance , rendering them unavailable  at critical times . seventh , during the final months of 2000 , some power  plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air  emissions credits . eighth , a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold  weather further drove up demand for power . finally , the increased power  costs in california could have been substantially mitigated through  long - term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short - term  power market .

' working group ' developments  following the caida members ' meeting on 8 feb 00 i ' ve attempted to define  exactly what problem we could consider getting an ietf working group  started on . my summary of the existing ietf wgs with interests in metrics  is given below ( appendix b ) , but it seems unlikely that we could get a  new ietf wg started .  i believe that we should instead run a single caida working group  on ' network metrics , ' rather than the two proposed earlier . my draft  of its charter is appended below . it focuses on producing educational  material about network measurement , and on developing new metrics - these  were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the caida members .  the wg co - chairs are  sue moon ( sprintlabs ) and brett watson ( mfn / abovenet )  you are invited to attend the first wg meeting .  the agenda is as follows . .  agenda for caida wg meeting on : thursday 2 mar 00  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  10 am - 4 pm , abovenet , downtown sjc ( see below for details )  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  1 . review wg charter  - is it reasonable as set out in the draft ?  - what should be removed or added ?  2 . work through revised charter in detail  - identify the work required for each part  - determine who ' s willing to work on it  - attempt to determine delivery times  3 . discussion of new metrics  - first attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered  4 . anything else ?  location : abovenet is located in the knight - ridder building ,  attached to the fairmont hotel complex . the address is  50 w . san fernando st .  san jose , ca 95113  rsvp : to help us with organising the meeting , please send email to  nevil @ caida . org telling us how many will attend from  your organisation .  cheers , nevil  nevil brownlee visiting researcher  phone : ( 619 ) 822 0893 caida , san diego  caida network metrics working group : draft charter , tue 23 feb 00  goals :  1 education  + faq on what does ' measuring the internet actually mean ? '  - why measure anyway ?  - what can be measured ? how ? where ? by whom ?  - active vs passive , end - to - end vs provider network only ,  application vs transport layer  - rating schemes : provider ' net performance ' pages , internet  ' weather map ' s , keynote , etc .  publish as caida web pages , or maybe as an info rfc  + survey paper on metrics and internet measurement  - current measurement efforts ( surveyor , ripe test traffic ,  amp , iperf , at & t , keynote , skitter , . . . )  - current tools  publish as caida web pages  2 service metrics  + define new metrics  - taxonomy of current metrics ( ippm , rtfm , itu , . . )  - summary of metrics used for current services  - gather information / ideas about new / emerging services ,  especially diffserv - based ones  - make list of new metrics , either to improve measurement of  existing services or to support new ones  [ list of ' metrics ' questions ( appendix a ) goes here ]  + organise experimental implementation / testing of tools  for new metrics  + make recommendations on implementation  - define core set of ' really useful ' metrics  - recommend that caida implement these as a  ' service measurement toolkit '  + publish new metric definitions through ippm or rtfm  + produce document "" measurement requirements for hardware / software  vendors . "" publish on caida web pages  appendix a : questions from the earlier draft caida wg charters  a . what types of network - and transport - layer metrics are being  used by isps in engineering and operating their networks ?  by customers for verifying service guarantees ?  b . what new services are being ( or are likely to be ) offered , e . g .  diffserv ? is there a need for higher - layer metrics to better  monitor and manage these services ?  c . will these new differentiated transport - and  application - layer services need new metrics ?  d . how can the service metrics be measured in a multi - isp  environment ?  e . how can customers verify these measurements ?  f . what requirements would service measurement introduce for  equipment vendors ?  g . how relevant are specific techniques ( e . g . which flow ) and  points of measurement to specific users ( isp , customer , etc . )  requirements ?  h . how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived  by users ? how do they correlate with performance ?  appendix b : background on the ietf working groups  * rtfm wg : realtime traffic flow measurement  rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two - way traffic flows ,  specified in terms of their end - point attributes . its primary goal was  to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the  following needs :  a . wider range of measurable quantities , e . g . those  relating to ipv 6 , and to class of service  b . simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c . better ways to control access to measured flow data  d . strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e . efficient hardware implementation  * ippm wg : ip performance measurement  the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can  be applied to the quality , performance , and reliability of internet  data delivery services . these metrics will be designed such that they  can be performed by network operators , end users , or independent  testing groups . it is important that the metrics not represent a value  judgement ( i . e . define "" good "" and "" bad "" ) , but rather provide unbiased  quantitative measures of performance .  rfcs  framework for ip performance metrics ( rfc 2330 )  metrics :  connectivity ( rfc 2678 ) ,  one - way delay ( rfc 2679 ) , one - way packet loss ( rfc 2680 )  round - trip delay ( rfc 2681 )  i - ds  bulk transfer capacity ( 2 x )  instantaneous packet delay variation  one - way loss patterns  * other wgs  the rmonmib wg is thinking about ' application performance  measurement . ' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just  mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how  should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .  in short  - rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes  - ippm has concentrated on transport - layer behaviour of the  current , best - effort internet .  - rmonmib is beginning to consider application - layer measurement ",0

"Subject: organizational changes  we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co -

"Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute  otc bbalert gdvi  news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website !  www . gdvi . net  otc bb  alert  spectacular operating results momentum  continues  sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million  99 . 8 %  revenue increase  278 % net  income increase  154 %  stockholders equity increase  79 %  increase in assets  $ 8  million order backlog  $ 50  million manufacturing capacity  overview  global diversified industries operates in the modular  building construction industry , and strategically targets the  california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in  central  california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art  manufacturing facility .  throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building  its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a  state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the  requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .  through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million  capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state  of  california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to  become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the  west coast .  gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion  school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by  california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion  an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before  the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and  subsequently invests in those companies .  global diversified has taken numerous strategic  development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating  strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive  growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with  previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum  businesses .  in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue  projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state  approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit  facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing  facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition  candidates through its aggressive growth plan .  profile  gdvi is a holding company that currently  operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a  modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work  and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and  manufacturing of modular type structures .  its principal customer base is currently educational  ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and  municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of  portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -  story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures  are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved  building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications  administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .  global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing  educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback  clause . the state of  california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular  classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful  bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities  portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the  originating school district . this process saves school districts  valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .  a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may  have access to future business for up to five years , depending on  the term of the piggyback contract .  the strategic focus on california schools  since 1998 ,  california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new  classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .  there are five compelling reasons for this trend :  modular  classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )  they cost  significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )  they offer  greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings  they are easier  to finance  they provide  financing incentives  to cope with population growth , the state department of  education estimates that  california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the  next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .  due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout  the california education sector , public and private schools are  expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their  additional classroom requirements over the next four years .  the california schools budget crisis  on  november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond  proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by  california  voters .  this bond measure passage does not include an approximate  $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school  districts throughout the state .  a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the  voters on the march 2004 .  these bond measures are about three times higher than the  record $ 9 . 2 billion bond  california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these  bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which  include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular  classroom construction and renovations .  money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and  private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at  community colleges and other institutions of higher learning  throughout  california .  gdvi business infrastructure  among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated ,  state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes  equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are  specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular  structures .  gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking  to add to its workforce as demand increases .  operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square  foot operating structure .  wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets ,  designs and manufactures the buildings  wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles  installation and building renovation .  symbol otc . bb  gdvi  recent price 13 . 5 cents  management team  philip hamilton , ceo and president  mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful  background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served  as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this  company from inception into one of  californias  largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools  and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter  industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater ,  california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the  company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales  of $ 50 , 000 , 000 .  adam de bard , vice president  mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the  manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as  vice president and chief  information officer of pacesetter industries .  ronald kilpatrick , director of finance  mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic  and international development and management of major corporations .  he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides  venture capital to projects in the  pacific rim .  recent headlines  global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to  increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility  pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new  order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery  pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 )  wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi  and geoi  pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 )  wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle  pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 )  global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets  from california modular company  pr newswire ( thu , may 26 )  global diversified industries , inc . modular division  implementing its fourth production line  pr newswire ( thu , may 19 )  talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton ,  president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc .  primezone media network ( tue , may 17 )  stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified  industries , inc .  primezone media network ( mon , may 16 )  global diversified industries ' modular division billings total  $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

"Subject: re : wall street micro news report  homeland security investments  the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have  changed  the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and  logical  security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in  the  banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,  a  wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for  information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by  2005 .  homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing  our  readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this  lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security  happen  with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position  ourselves in  such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to  capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security  investments is here to help our readers do just that .  with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,  inc .  this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long  terms .  symbol : ( vnbl )  current price : 0 . 08  short term target price : 0 . 35  12 month target price : 1 . 20  * * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *  * at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency  identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .  * vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location  technology .  * vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies  and  governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such  technology  has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials  designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .  * vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .  locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea  ports ,  mines , nuclear facilities , and more .  * as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has  made vnbl a hot buy .  news on vnbl  malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc .  ( otcbb : vnbl -  news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and  other  security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that will assist in the automation of the identification and  control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in  the  oil & gas and petrochemical industries .  although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they  can  also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,  such as  a well filling with water .  as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide  the  safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the  entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is  essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would  enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or  danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid  can  also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and  chemical  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .  vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective  measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against  threat .  preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  u . s .  industry and economy .  the company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position  vinoble in  a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the company will require  for  growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to  do  without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of  constant threat .  this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is  exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .  information within this email contains "" forward looking statements ""  within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and  section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that  express or involve discussions with respect to predictions ,  expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals ,  assumptions or  future  events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be  "" forward looking statements .
